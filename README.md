ArraySorter
===========

Implements multiple array sorting algorithms. The array is of set size.  Currently this value is set at 10. Such a small number gets quickly sorted. I chose 10 so the user can compare the original and sorted array. If the user would like to actually see the time each algorithm takes, please set the array to a larger size(say 10000). This can be set by locating line 21 of main.cpp.
